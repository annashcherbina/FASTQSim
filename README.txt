The software provides two types of capabilities: 
-----------------------------------------------
1. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) datasets characterization. Characterization refers to the following: 
   a. Histogram of read length.
   b. Min/Max/Mean quality scores for each base position in a read. 
   c. Insertion characterization. This refers to calculating the probability of an insertion at each position in a sequence, the probability of insertions of a particular size, and the probability of a repeat insertion of a particular size. 
   d. Deletion characterization, same parameters as insertions. 
   e. Single base pair mutations. This refers to calculating the probability of a mutation at each position in a sequence, the probability of mutating from one base to another       (i.e. c--> g versus c--> a) 
   f. Primer histogram. By computing the frequency of each primer, "pileups" of low complexity reads can be detected. 
   g. Read alignment quality histogram. Read alignment refers to the percent of a read from the data that aligns to a matching hit from the BLAST database. This value depends on the data quality and the instrument used: the value is around 98% for Roche 454 data, but around 90% for PacBio data.   
2. "Spiking" of reads from a fasta source into a background fastq dataset. The spiking is performed in a manner such that the characteristics of the spiked reads are identical    to those of the background reads, so a spiked read is indistinguishable from a background read. 

Executing the software: 
-----------------------
There are two main scripts in the top-level "FASTQSim" directory: FASTQcharacterize.sh and FASTQspike.sh These should be run to perform the characterization and spiking tasks described above. Helper python files are located in the "src" directory. 
An example is provided in the "example.sh" script in the top-level directory. 

1. FASTQcharacterize.sh 
The script can be run in three ways: 
    a. Using an externally generated alignment file (BAM or SAM format) to perform characterization 

    sh FASTQcharacterize.sh -input Example5.fq -reference homo_sapien.gdna -sam Example5.sam 

    b. Using an externally generated BLAST alignment file to perform characterization 

    sh FASTQcharacterize.sh -input Example5.fq -reference homo_sapien.gdna -blastresults Example5.blast 

    c. Aligning a subset of the FASTQ file to a reference with the BLAST algorithm and performing characterization on the resulting alignment 

    sh FASTQcharacterize.sh -input Example5.fq -reference homo_sapien.gdna  
    

Inputs: 
	a. The fastq file to be characterized. (-input ) 
	b. A FASTA database to be used for BLAST. (-reference)  The FASTA database should mirror the source of the host/background in the input FASTQ file. In the provided example, "Example5.fq", there is a human host, so the associated database is "homo_sapiens.gdna". By default, the characterization program will select 5000 reads from the input file, perform a BLAST search against the referene database, and parse the output to determine the input file characteristics. Two-threaded BLAST with a maximum of 10 hits per input sequence is used. These parameters are selected for efficiency. For a more thorough characterization of the data the "-full" flag should be used. If this flag is supplied, BLAST will be performed on the entire input FASTQ file, not just 5000 sequences. 
	c. Alternatively, a BLAST results file may be used as an input (-blastresults). If the BLAST file is provided for the input FASTQ, a reference sequence does not need to be supplied. The software will use the supplied BLAST result to characterize the data. 
	d. BAM/SAM alignment file (-bam / -sam) 
	If a BAM or SAM file is specified, this file will be used to calculate characterization statistics for the dataset. The algorithm converts a BAM file to SAM format and calls the "calmd" command from samtools to identify SNPs in the aligned reads. 
	e.If the -plothistogram flag is set, graphs will be generated for the output characterization files. 

Outputs: 
All outputs will be stored in the "FASTQsim" directory. The following files will be generated (using the provided Example5.fq input file as an example):

2. FASTQspike.sh
In the provided example, the background file is "Example5.fq", the same that was characterized in the above step. An E. coli genome is spiked in 
at a coverage of 20x. This genome is circular. A plasmid, EU496103_with_xis_AAv.fasta is spiked in at a coverage of 200x. This plasmid is also circular. See the script example.sh for how to perform 
this spiking operation. 

Inputs: 
a. Background FASTQ file to be spiked (Example5.fq) 
b. List of background characterization files. This is typically the summary.csv file generated by the characterization script (i.e. Example5summary.csv) 

Multiple read sources can be used for spiking. Provide inputs e,f,g for each source of spiked reads. 
c. coverage for spiked reads (20x in example.sh)  
d. fasta file for spiked reads (ecoli.fasta) 
e. Are the spiked reads from a circular genome (True/False)
f. If the optional -plothistogram flag is set, statistical plots will be generated comparing the spiked reads with the background reads.  
g. The optional -o flag can be used to specify output file name prefixes for the spiked read fastq files and the full fastq files (consisting of spiked reads inserted into the background files) 
h. THe optional -threads flag can be used to specify the number of threads to use to run the program. The default is single-threaded. 

Outputs: Stored in the "FASTQsim" directory 

a. FASTQ file containing the spiked reads generated from the sources (example/Example5_Spiked.fq). 
b. FASTQ file containing the full dataset consisting of the background FASTQ file and the spiked reads inserted at random positions (example/Example5_Full.fq).
c. Histograms (.png) generated if the '-plothistogram' flag is used.
